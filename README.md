# ARCOS API

These are the files that help run the [ARCOS API](https://arcos-api.ext.nile.works/__swagger__/).

The Washington Post [published](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/#download-resources) a significant portion of a database that tracks the path of every opioid pain pill, from manufacturer to pharmacy, in the United States between 2006 and 2012. We have reported a [number of stories](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/20/opioid-files/) using this data set, but we believe there are more stories to be told.

We are making this data accessible [as an API](https://arcos-api.ext.nile.works/__swagger__/) for everyone to download and [use in their reporting](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/08/12/post-released-deas-data-pain-pills-heres-what-local-journalists-are-using-it/) or research to promote a deeper understanding of the regional and local effects of the opioid crisis.
